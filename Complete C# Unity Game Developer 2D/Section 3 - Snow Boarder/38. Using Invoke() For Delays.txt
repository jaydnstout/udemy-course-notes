Creating A Delay

- There are 2 useful approaches to "waiting a moment".

	- Invoke

	- Coroutines

- Invoke is a bit easier to understand but not as powerful.



Using Invoke()

- When we call Invoke() we need to pass in the name of the method we want to call after a delay, as well as how long the delay is.
