What Are Methods?

- Methods (also called Functions) execute blocks of code that makes our game do things

- We can:
	- Use the methods already available in Unity
	- Create our own methods



Creating And Calling

- When we CREATE a method, we are giving it a name and saying what it should do

- When we CALL a method we are saying "do the things now please"



Namespaces are libraries that you can use (ex. UnityEngine)

Classes group similar things together, and in particular classes we can execute methods.

Global rotation locks movement direction regardless of a GameObject's rotation, whereas local rotation changes it relative to its rotation.

YOUR CODE WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT PUT A SEMICOLON AT THE END OF EACH LINE!
