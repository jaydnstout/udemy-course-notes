Destroying Game Objects

- We call Destroy() to delete game objects from the scene
- Destroy requires us to tell it ("pass in") 2 things:

	- Which game object to destroy
	- How much delay until its destroyed (optional)

ex. Destroy(theMonster.gameObject, 0.5f);



You can use an exclamation mark (!) to negate a bool in an if statement.

ex. 'if (hasPackage)' means 'if (hasPackage == true)'

    'if (!hasPackage)' means 'if (hasPackage == false)'
