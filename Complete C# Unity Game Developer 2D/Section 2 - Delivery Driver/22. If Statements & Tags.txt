If Statements

- If statements let us check if something is true or not and then do something based upon the result.

ex. if (this thing is true)
    {
        do this thing;
    }

    if (I'm hungry)
    {
        Eat junk food while Mom isn't watching;
    }



Why Use Tags?

- Tags allow us to easily check in code if something belongs to a particular category of thing.
