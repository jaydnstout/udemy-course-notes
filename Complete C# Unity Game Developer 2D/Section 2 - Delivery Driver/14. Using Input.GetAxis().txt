Unity Input System

- Input System: converting the player's physical action (eg. button press, key press) into information for the game
- Unity has used a few different input systems
- Currently there is "old" system and "new" system
- We'll use both in this course
- Use "old" system for this current project



Edit > Project Settings > Input Manager



One disadvantage of using the "old" system is that axis names are case-sensitive, meaning when using them you must type them exactly as named.

Variables can be defined within methods (particularly the Update method) if you need to use them there only. There, they do not need to be pre-defined.

When calling variables in a method (ex. transform.Translate) you can use a minus sign before the variable name if the variable is numerical to negate its value (ex. moveSpeed is 1, so calling -moveSpeed will return -1)
