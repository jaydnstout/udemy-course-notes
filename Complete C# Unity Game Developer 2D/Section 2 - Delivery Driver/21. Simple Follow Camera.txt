Creating A "Reference"

- If we want to access / change / call anything other than this game object's transform, we need to create a reference.

- Ie. We need to tell Unity what the "thing" is that we are referring to.



You can use a Vector3 to modify parameters within the Transform component.

ex. transform.position = target.transform.position + new Vector3(0, 0, -10);

I used this code to make the camera follow the player without clipping into the "ground", since it was originally on the same Z level as everything else.
