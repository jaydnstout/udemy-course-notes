Sprites Are Made Of Pixels

- Resolution refers to the number of pixels in an image
- Higher resolution = more pixels



Unity Units

- 1 Unity Unit has no meaning, just what ever we want it to represent. It could be meters, kilometers, miles, inches, whatever we want.



Pixels Per Unit

- New assets default to 100 pixels per Unity unit.
- Bigger: less pixels per unit

This is useful for giving 2D assets precise measurements.
