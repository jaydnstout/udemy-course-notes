Variables Are Like Boxes

- Variables help us store, manipulate and refer to information
- Each variable has a NAME (ex. hitPoints)
- Each variable contains DATA (or VALUE, ex. 20)
- Each variable is of a particular TYPE (ex. int/integer/whole number)

ex. int hitPoints = 20;



Some Common Types Of Variables

- int/integer (whole numbers)
- float (fractional numbers, up to 6 decimal places)
- double (fractional numbers, up to 15 decimal places, irrelevant)
- bool (true/false)
- string (sequence of characters/anything contained within quotation marks)

ex.
	float speed = 3.8f;
	bool isAlive = true;
	string myName = "Jaydn";
